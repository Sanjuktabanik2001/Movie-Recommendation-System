# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project aims to create a personalized movie recommendation engine using consise machine-learning techniques that suggest relevant movies to users based on their preferrences and  movie attributes such as ratings, overview, genres, keywords, cast and crew.

**Key Features**

***Data Collection and Preprocessing***: I gathered a large dataset of movie information, including genres, ratings, reviews, and user preferences. The dataset was cleaned and processed to ensure data integrity and consistency.

***Feature Engineering***: I extracted relevant features from the dataset, such as movie genres, actors, directors, and user ratings, to create a comprehensive representation of movies and users.

***Content-Based Filtering***: I developed a content-based recommendation engine that analyzed the attributes of movies, such as genres, directors, and actors, to suggest movies with similar characteristics to those the user has enjoyed in the past.

***Evaluation and Optimization***: I conducted rigorous evaluation and testing of the recommendation system to measure its accuracy and performance. I employed techniques like cross-validation and metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision to assess the system's effectiveness. Additionally, I optimized the algorithms and parameters to enhance the quality of recommendations.

***User Interface***: To enhance user experience, I designed and implemented an intuitive user interface where users could input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.
